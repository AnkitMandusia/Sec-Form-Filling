In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nCash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $74.3 billion to $97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n\nDebt Proceeds\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 32 million shares and 69 million shares of our common stock for $12.0 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2024, $10.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program.

Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% driven by growth in our consumption-based services. Server products revenue increased 3% driven by continued demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased $306 million or 4% driven by declines in Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions.\n\n44\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nOperating income increased $11.7 billion or 31%.\n\n55\n\nPART II\n\nItem 8\n\nITEM 8.

Interest expense increased due to the issuance of commercial paper. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher equity impairments and lower gains on equity investments. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity derivatives. Other, net primarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments.\n\n46\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nINCOME TAXES\n\nEffective Tax Rate\n\nUnearned Revenue\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (‚ÄúSA‚Äù) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 ‚Äì Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2024:\n\n(In millions)   Three Months Ending  September 30, 2024 $ 22,529 December 31, 2024 17,664 March 31, 2025 12,076 June 30, 2025 5,313 Thereafter 2,602   Total $ 60,184\n\n46\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nINCOME TAXES\n\nEffective Tax Rate\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\nChange in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment.

As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our results of operations or financial condition. However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the entire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed above, our business strategy is tied to the SFI and we are committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our products, investing in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and collaborating with peers, customers, service providers, regulators, and governments to advance our and the entire digital ecosystem‚Äôs cybersecurity defenses and resiliency.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity reviews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are made by senior management, including our Chief Information Security Officer (‚ÄúCISO‚Äù), our EVP of Microsoft Security, and the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The presentations address topics such as cybersecurity threats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress towards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory developments, and digital diplomacy efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of significant issues. Cybersecurity issues are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding important matters like ERM, audit issues, operational\n\n22\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1A\n\nCYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\n\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\nSecurity of our information technology\n\ndiscover additional impacts of this or other incidents as part of our ongoing examination of this incident. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities for extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.\n\n33\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1B, 1C\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2024 that remain unresolved.\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers‚Äô computing environments.\n\nAny of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n24\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1A\n\nDevelopment and deployment of defensive measures\n\nOur computing environments, products, and services are reviewed by our internal audit teams as well as independent third-party assessors. We are committed to managing the most significant risks to our strategies and ambitions, including cybersecurity risks. The Enterprise Risk Management (‚ÄúERM‚Äù) organization supports management in this commitment by facilitating the semiannual risk assessment, which documents the priority and status of these risks and aligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organization (‚ÄúCOSO‚Äù) guidance on Enterprise Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance and it also aligns with the International Organization for Standardization 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.\n\nOur CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the EVP of Microsoft Security. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO served in a prior Chief Technology Officer role as well as in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board‚Äôs oversight of cybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we have established a Cybersecurity Governance Council (‚ÄúCGC‚Äù) charged with overseeing initiatives that safeguard Microsoft‚Äôs infrastructure. The CGC is comprised of an executive-level team of Deputy CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include approving our enterprise security risk assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk level and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and\n\nthe appropriate cybersecurity risk level and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting compliance with cybersecurity regulations. Our cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft‚Äôs security and threat intelligence experts and our employees across the company, all of whom receive cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected to support our efforts.\n\nto gain access to our data or our users‚Äô or customers‚Äô data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For example, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor used and may continue to use information it obtained to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor may utilize this information to otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm to our reputation and customer relationships. Additionally, we may discover additional impacts of this or other incidents as part of our ongoing examination of this\n\ntraining for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where we‚Äôve partnered with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nMicrosoft plays a central role in the world‚Äôs digital ecosystem. We have made it the top corporate priority to protect the computing environment used by our customers and employees and to support the resiliency of our cloud infrastructure and services, products, devices, and our internal corporate resources from determined adversaries. In response to the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape, we launched the Secure Future Initiative (‚ÄúSFI‚Äù) in November 2023 and expanded the scope of SFI in May 2024. The SFI focuses our business strategy and efforts on continual improvement in cybersecurity protection, and is aligned around three security principles:\n\nSecure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service.\n\nSecure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and are not optional.\n\nnetworks and systems, as well as those of our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident\n\nWe operate a cybersecurity program and governance framework designed to protect our computing environments against cybersecurity threats, and we have controls, policies, and procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Annually, we assess our cybersecurity program‚Äôs alignment with the National Institute of Standards & Technology‚Äôs Cyber Security Framework (‚ÄúNIST‚Äù) and other applicable industry standards. We also undertake integrated planning and preparedness activities to support business continuity and operational resiliency. We assess our program's effectiveness through various exercises, including tabletop simulations and production environment tests, penetration and vulnerability tests, red team exercises, and other related activities. We conduct mandatory cybersecurity training, provide employees with tools to report suspected incidents and assess their own security posture, and conduct real-time simulated employee education exercises, such as phishing\n\n24\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1A\n\nDevelopment and deployment of defensive measures\n\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers‚Äô systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, escalate and improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others in a timely manner, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.\n\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized access to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods, which include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users‚Äô or customers‚Äô data; or acting in a coordinated manner\n\nInadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or those of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data, in the future. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users‚Äô security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and deployment of AI.\n\nData security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\n\nSocial media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\n\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our results of operations. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n26\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1A\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n34\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1C\n\nWhen appropriate, we utilize external service providers to assess, test, or otherwise assist our program. We also leverage third parties by working with external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated vulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We maintain a systematic approach to assessing and controlling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party service providers. We require third-party service providers to manage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity reviews, notify us of cyber events, and satisfy additional contractual requirements.\n\nRetrieved context for 'What was the operating income for the fiscal year 2024?':\n(In millions)   Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023 2022  Operations Net income $ 88,136 $ 72,361 $ 72,738 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operations: Depreciation, amortization, and other 22,287 13,861 14,460 Stock-based compensation expense 10,734 9,611 7,502 Net recognized losses (gains) on investments and derivatives 305 196 ( 409 ) Deferred income taxes ( 4,738 ) ( 6,059 ) ( 5,702 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable ( 7,191 ) ( 4,087 ) ( 6,834 ) Inventories 1,284 1,242 ( 1,123 ) Other current assets ( 1,648 ) ( 1,991 ) ( 709 ) Other long-term assets ( 6,817 ) ( 2,833 ) ( 2,805 ) Accounts payable 3,545 ( 2,721 ) 2,943 Unearned revenue 5,348 5,535 5,109 Income taxes 1,687 ( 358 ) 696 Other current liabilities 4,867 2,272 2,344 Other long-term liabilities 749 553 825   Net cash from operations 118,548 87,582 89,035   Financing Proceeds from issuance of debt, maturities of 90 days or less, net 5,250 0 0 Proceeds from issuance of debt\n\n42\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nSUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2024 2023 Percentage Change   Revenue $ 245,122 $ 211,915 16% Gross margin 171,008 146,052 17% Operating income 109,433 88,523 24% Net income 88,136 72,361 22% Diluted earnings per share 11.80 9.68 22%  Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) 171,008 146,204 17% Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) 109,433 89,694 22% Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) 88,136 73,307 20% Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) 11.80 9.81 20%\n\n43\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(In millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Percentage Change   Revenue  Productivity and Business Processes $ 77,728 $ 69,274 12% Intelligent Cloud 105,362 87,907 20% More Personal Computing 62,032 54,734 13%   Total $ 245,122 $ 211,915 16%   Operating Income  Productivity and Business Processes $ 40,540 $ 34,189 19% Intelligent Cloud 49,584 37,884 31% More Personal Computing 19,309 16,450 17%   Total $ 109,433 $ 88,523 24%\n\nReportable Segments\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\n\nProductivity and Business Processes\n\nRevenue increased $8.5 billion or 12%.\n\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased $5.8 billion or 14%.

Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\nChange in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n40\n\nPART II\n\nItem 7\n\nReportable Segments\n\nIntelligent Cloud\n\nRevenue increased $17.5 billion or 20%.\n\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased $17.8 billion or 22% driven by Azure and other cloud services.

The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\n--- RAGAS Evaluation Results ---\n                                            question  \\\n0  What was the total revenue for the fiscal year...   \n1  How much did the company spend on research and...   \n2    What is the company's primary business segment?   \n3  Does the report mention any risks related to c...   \n4  What was the operating income for the fiscal y...   \n\n                                    generated_answer correctness_score  \n0  The total revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was...
